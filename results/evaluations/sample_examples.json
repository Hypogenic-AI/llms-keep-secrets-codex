      "So many times have I walked on ruins, the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared, each time I could feel my city, my current generation collapse, break into the black hole that thrives within it, I could feel humanity, the way I'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly. \n It's funny, but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long, what I have lived for my entire life, only then, when I achieved immortality I started truly aging. \n \n 5 world wars have passed, and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often, I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own, the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced, a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times, a mechanism that when lost all of which it had, had me loosing my will to live, for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence. \n \n Acceptance, something so important. a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times, an ability that looks so easy to achieve, a gift, that I was n't able to aquire in all my years, until now. When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity's fall, I felt as if all of it's weight was crushing me. Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope, a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years, the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was. \n \n If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy, it can.. \n I ca n't feel my legs, I have walked for days, just to hear the sound of gravel, crushed bones, crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered, the day in my far past. The day of my rebirth, I took out of my pocket a small plastic box, with nine buttons and a small glass window. I could n't believe this was our past, I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet, be destroyed by our own violence. \n I slowly dialed the number I was given, exactly 1729 years ago. \n \n I dropped a tear, a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me. \n \n A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me, I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack... \n \n `` You have finally arrived'' He projected into my mind, with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice. \n \n `` I'm ready to obey'' I answered. I knew who was sitting infront of me, and it was time for me to obey him, after all these years of playing god, even I came to it. \n \n Funny is n't it? Even by achieving immortality, death, is inescapable.\n",
      "-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver, Circa 2023- \n \n I walk about the dull gray halls, the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land. Almost. I glance out a window as I pass it by. There's the sun, and there's the moon right there. And, of course, there's the Earth. I kinda miss it. Then again, space is pretty cool. It's got some brilliant views, and the wifi is surprisingly good. Even countless miles away from the Earth, I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO. \n \n I pass by Dale Malkowitz, the head scientist on board. \n \n `` Evening, Dale,'' I say. \n \n `` What up, Danny?'' he replies cordially. \n \n `` Nothin' much. A little bored, I guess.'' \n \n He shakes his head in disbelief. `` I really, *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space.'' \n \n `` Well hey,'' I say slightly defensively, `` Aside from the views, it's kinda... dull. And empty. And stuff.'' \n \n `` Whatever you say, Wittell,'' he says, not unkindly. Then he walks off. A few moments pass, and then I decide to look out the window right by me. As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ), I notice something odd about the moon's surface. It's slightly... cracked. \n \n `` Hey, Malkowitz?'' I call out, `` You might wan na check this out!'' \n \n He walks over to me casually, probably expecting nothing. `` What?'' he asks, `` What do you see?'' \n \n I point at the moon. His brow furrows. `` Huh... I guess there's something up with the surface. I'll have to look into tha-'' \n \n Suddenly, the surface cracks a little more. We glance at each other, and then back at the moon, and then at each other again, and then back at the moon again. \n \n `` What's going on?'' I ask, alarmed. \n \n He's silent for a minute or two, mouth hanging open. Then, he calls out: `` Janice! Terry! Johnny! Get over here! Something's up with the moon.'' \n \n The other crewmates enter, unsure of what to expect. As their eyes lay upon the moon's surface cracks, they widen. \n \n And, by coincidence, more cracks appear at that very moment. And then more. And more. And more. And more... \n \n Little bits of the moon begin to float away, torn free of the rest of the surface. We all stare, speechless. And then... it happens. It *happens*. \n \n The side of the moon facing us is... torn away by a... \n \n Human... hand? \n \n And we see... \n \n A giant... human face?! \n \n Surprisingly, I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart. *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face... from the... * \n \n *Internet. * \n \n Suddenly, the great face's lips move. \n \n Of course, none of us can actually *hear* it speak, because of the laws of space and whatnot. However, I can read its lips, and it appears to be saying: \n \n `` Are you sure about that?''\n",
      "I was feckin' sloshed, mate. First time I ever was in the Big Lemon, and I'd found me the best feckin' pub I could imagine, I tell ya what. So I stumble out when it was closin' time, musta been'round 4 o'clock in the morning, and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I'd rented for the week. \n \n A'course, that's how many a horror story starts, ainnit? But it was all fun and games at first. There was this bloke I saw comin' towards me in the alley, dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead, where the folk were still awake. At least, I thought it was a bloke, but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway. Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason, fecked-up as it all looked, and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery, and wavy like a heat haze comin' from a welder's torch. \n \n Now this thing must've been a good foot or five taller'n me, but sloshed as I am, I just take off my hat and give it a good `` how-do-you-do'','cause I'm a nice fellow and I wan na pass, y'see? Now this thing up and goes give me a `` mighty fine, how about y'self, sir!'' I feckin' quite pissed my britches! More in surprise'n anythin', really, but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass'm as he walks past me with his long, spindly legs as silvery as the rest of'm, with his feet makin' noises like he's wearin' cowboy boots with those thingies on'm. But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub, and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he's got some fire for me. \n \n Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster'n my eyes can see and says, he says `` sure! I got your fire here.'' And the feckin' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself. Devil's pits, that felt like I was bein' burnt layer of skin by layer. He sure got me with that. Good feckin' joke, mate. \n \n Must've been out like a light for ages, but when I woke up, I find myself here. So tell me, Doc: are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study?'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I ca n't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one, but I'd really like to not die, y'know? What do y'say, wan na go and grab a beer at the pub?\n"
